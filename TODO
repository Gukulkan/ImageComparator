Pluses:
- The app works at least in some way.
- Algorithm works with rectangles rather than pixels for optimal performance (with critical bugs).
- Images of different sizes are processed.
- Has UI (primitive).

Minuses:
- Code smells. Service should not be a utility or utility should not be named, as a service. Formatting issues. Long methods with mixed responsibilities. Hard-coded paths to files.
- Runnable file, which is the part of the expected deliverables, is missed.
- Color comparison is incorrect. Color components are stored in bytes (int = 4 bytes; 1 byte per a color â€“ alpha, red, green, blue):
dark-dark-red: 0 50 0 0 - in integer form will be equal to 3276800
dark-dark-green: 0 0 50 0 - in integer form will be equal to 12800
Mathematical operations with original integers are senseless.
